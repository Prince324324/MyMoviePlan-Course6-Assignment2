**1. Node.js and Express.js:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to build server-side applications using JavaScript. It's designed to be efficient and asynchronous, making it well-suited for building scalable web applications. Express.js is a popular framework built on top of Node.js, simplifying the process of creating web applications and APIs by providing a set of tools for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

**2. Database Management with MongoDB:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format. It's schema-less and flexible, making it suitable for applications with evolving data requirements. In the context of a movie ticket booking website, MongoDB could store information about movies, users, bookings, and more.

**3. Models and Schemas:
In a MongoDB-based application, models and schemas define the structure of your data. Schemas define the fields and their data types for your documents (records). Models provide an interface for interacting with the database, allowing you to perform operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

**4. Routes and Routing:
Routes define the endpoints of your web application or API. Using Express.js, you can create routes to handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each route corresponds to a specific URL and is associated with a handler function that executes when the route is accessed.

**5. Authentication and User Management:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users. Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. It provides strategies for different authentication methods (local, social logins, etc.) and makes it easier to secure your application by controlling access to certain routes and resources based on user roles.

**6. Middleware:
Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects and can perform tasks like validation, authentication, and data manipulation before passing control to the next middleware or route handler.

**7. Frontend Integration:
While Node.js and Express.js handle the backend logic, you also need to build the frontend to create a user interface that users can interact with. This involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and render web pages, and making AJAX requests to the backend APIs to fetch and display data.

**8. APIs and RESTful Architecture:
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In a RESTful architecture, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are designed to be stateless, and resources are represented as URLs. Your movie ticket booking website would expose APIs to perform actions like getting movie information, registering users, and making bookings.
